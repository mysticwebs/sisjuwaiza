                <p>Pedagogy is an art. It has to come from within like any art. Gone are the days when the pupils sat in dumb astonishment and nervous reverence in front of a ‘Guru’. Now, a new era of intrapersonal relationship between the teacher and the taught has been ushered in; where at times even the teacher becomes the learner. The ‘tunnel vision’ does not exist anymore. With the advent of the computer technology this task has been made even easier than ever, but at the same time, demanding a great deal of work and perseverance.<br>
                    A class room situation should be a situation where there is a healthy conversation that is carried on between the teacher and the taught, a participatory method of teaching. Each day would then add a new dimension to the child’s profile giving him an opportunity to meet and accomplish new challenges. Teachers are expected to therefore, equip themselves with energy, integrity, creativity, enthusiasm and most importantly an openness of mind, which is vital for the development of the school in general and the child in particular.<br>
                    The participation does not stop with the teacher and the taught but goes beyond the class room. An extended relationship is being established with the parents, who are now considered partners in the bringing up of the children. To comprehend correctly, the complexity and the composition of teaching is the name of the game. The term “Flipped class room” applies to the extended learning that happens at home. When a child goes up on to a podium or goes up to receive a prize, more often than not, the hard work of a parent behind the scene is what is evident.</p>
